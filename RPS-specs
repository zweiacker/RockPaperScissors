RockPaperScissors SPEC  //  BASIC CONCEPTS AND ASSUMPTIONS
----------------------------------------------------------

player = starts a new RPS-game
opponent = is challenged by a player to participate in a game


- players know each other by address
- players are communicating outside the contract, e.g. announcing that they started a game.

- players start a new game by specifying the opponent's address, their encrypted move and bet.
- players can only start one game at a time. The game must be settled before a new one can start.
- you can be invited as the opponent in many other games, started by other players.
- as players can only initiate one game at a time, opponents can refer to the game by the player's address
- opponent players can check the bet amount of the current game by calling an internal function, if needed

- opponents respond by sending their move along with sufficient funds to match the bet
	. if funds too low - break
	. if funds too high - play + assign excess funds to the balance
	. if funds are sufficient then play
	. move is not encrypted

- players can chose not to send a bet value when starting a new game, in which case 
	. the bet is the same as their balance
	. if no balance, then break

- opponents have to send funds which must at least match the bet.

- to avoid blocking the procedures by anyone player or opponent, time-based measures have been implemented
	. opponents must respond within a specified time frame (playing period)
	. players must reveal what their move was within a specified time frame (reveal period)
	. the game can only be settled if periods are over or certain constraints met

- player or opponent can enforce the settlement of the game, hence avoiding to block each other
	. if playing period has passed without a response from opponent, then player is credited back the bet.
	. if reveal period has passed without the player having revealed, then opponent is credited twice the bet.
	. final settlement does not happen automatically, but can be initiated by either party.
	. settlement is a function, it is checking the status of the game and determines the winner
	. winner gets credited twice the bet to their balance

- players can withdraw their balance
	. anytime, but not while they are the owner of an unsettled game.

What could be done in addition:
- maintain a player's list from which players can chose an opponent
- implement automatic settlement, e.g. by another contract that polls for unsettled games
